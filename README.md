# Fusion

This plugin was made possible by the direct and indirect contributions of several developers. This code has not aged perfectly, and some of the design decisions made early on show a slight lack of experience on my part. But overall, this plugin has a lot of features packed in and slightly hidden away within the code, with a lot of room for improvement and easy tweaking.

Some notable features:
* 20 kits with unique attributes
* Graphical warp system
* Custom region system with flags designed to mix up gameplay (https://youtu.be/IQsarHYG0kM)

Download links:
* Spigot: N/A yet
* Bukkit: N/A yet

Fusion is being released to the public in the hope that someone may one day find it useful, whether it's a server owner looking for some spice to throw on their players, or a developer looking to work on an open-source project. We will eventually get around to creating documentation for the plugin and its features, but for now, you're gonna kind of have to wing it.

If anyone is interested in making changes to the code, send me a pull request. Until I see any sort of interest, however, expect direct forced pushes to the master branch from us, so message @Lemonbus before you make a huge change that can't be merged into the code base <3.

This plugin uses extendedclip's PlaceHolderAPI for placeholders designed for scoreboards (we used FeatherBoard). Our own scoreboard code was relatively inefficient. The API made it a lot easier for us to just write it out and never look at it again :P. https://github.com/extendedclip/PlaceholderAPI
